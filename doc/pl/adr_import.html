Import thousands of addresses at once.
Select CSV-file from which you wish to import addesses.
The CSV-file must have the following format:
   <em>email,f0,f1,f2,f3,f4,f5,f6,f7,f8,f9</em>
   The delimiter can be ',' or ';' or '|'.
Select one or more groups the addresses should become a member of.
Select status for new and existing addesses and select if they should be active or inactive.
(If unsure, leave as is 'New, Acrive' / 'No changes')
If an addres already exists, it will be updated and added to selected groups if it is not already a member.
If you uncheck 'Merge Groups' existing addresses will only be assigned/moved to the selected groups.
