INSTALL

Update:

	See UPDATE

Notes:

	see FAQ http://www.tellmatic.org/faq

						
Installation:
	If possible create a subdomain like tellmatic.[yourdomain].[tld] with a separate dierectory.
	Unpack the archive file to your local harddisc.
	Copy the directory tellmatic-[xxx] or the content of this directory completely to your server via ftp into a directory of your choice. Images must be transfered in Binary Mode 
	(Auto Mode is OK, but sometimes the ftp programm is broken and transfers images in textmode, this is a but in the ftp client, not in Tellmatic)
	You can also copy the archiv via ssh or similar or use wget on your server. Please update user and groups for your needs after unpacking (chown)
	The directory where you install Tellmatic and the 'include' directory must be writeable by the webserver - use chmod function of your ftp programm and set permissions to 0775 or 0777
	
	Now call install.php via your famous Browser and enter your data.
	Select language for installation and accept license.
	All fields are required except SMTP Data, which you can enter later on. (But you MUST set these values to send mails!)
	The values for SMTP/POP3 are not checked, make sure theire valid!
	Tellmatic is now installed, the configuration-file 'include/tm_config.inc' is written and database tables were created
	The following directories must have write permisison too:
	
		admin/tmp
		files/
		files/logs
		files/forms
		files/import_export
		files/newsletter
		files/newsletter/images
		files/attachements
		files/reports
		files/tmp
		tpl (only for installation)

	If there occurs some error, please follow the instructions.
	Please delete, move or rename 
	'install.php'
	after successfull installation
	
	Tellmatic saves a .htpasswd file in /include. The include directory must have write permissions.

		INFO:
	
			install.php creates a file called '.htpasswd', it includes username and crypted password for acces to the restricted directories

	Please edit path to 'tm_config.inc' in 'include/send_it.php', 'subscribe.php', 'unsubscribe.php' - enter complete path here


	download geoip database from http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity
		http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
		unzip and copy the file to include/geoip/GeoLiteCity.dat
	
	call admin/index.php, enter username and password at login page, ready, enjoy mailing :)

	To send via cronjob via wget: 
		*/5 * * * * wget http://[user:passwort]@[domain]/[tellmatic-installdir]/include/send_it.php > /dev/null
	(you must add username and pw), 
	or use php cli (recommended!):
		*/5 * * * * /path/to/php-cli-binary /path/to/include/send_it.php > /dev/null
	Sending Newsletters at a specific time is only possible with cronjobs! If you can't create Cronjobs on your Server, you have to use manual sending.
	
	Since Release 1.0.8.7 Tellmatic includes some Scripts for auto-bouncemanagemewnt and address validation.
	These Scripts are als meant to run via a cronjob.
	Do the cron stuff too for these scripts, create a cronjob and run script every few minutes or hours.
	
	* include/bounce_it.php: auto-bouncemanagement, set up in gui 'admin' -> 'settings' and create a cronjob to run it e.g. every 2 hours (don't set the limits too high). Edit include Path at top of file and remove the exit command!
	You can run this Script manually via Browser from the Tellmatic menu in the 'management' section
	 	
	* include/check_it.php: auto-address validation, set up in gui 'admin' -> 'settings' and create a cronjob to run it e.g. every 10 minutes (don't set the limits too high). Edit include Path at top of file and remove the exit command!
	You also can run this Script manually via Browser from the Tellmatic menu in the 'management' section.

I will not answer question via e-mail without a donation, use the forum instead.

Important: 1and1 or Strato-Users should watch the forum, it contains workarounds to get tellmatic running on such "special configured" hosts.
