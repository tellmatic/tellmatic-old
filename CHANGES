			users who have downloaded 1.0.4 before, should only update send_it.php

			and save it as send_it.php in the include-directory.
		- install php contains a check for php5 and throws a message, not needed anymore.

	27.03.2007 - a new bugfix-release....
	bugs in 1.0.3-a, fixed for 1.0.4:
		- install.php: if mnldir is empty, use .
		- subscribe.php: when a member has unsubscribed and subscribes again, the address is marked as new again , but leaves inactive, now it sets the address active again	
		- fixed gettext implementation ... _() instead of __() was used by ___()
		- Empty directories /files... etc. are included again, some people reported problems. In some cases PHP settings dont allow the script to create subdirectories or full chmod.
		- In menu 'new delivery job' link was wrong.
		- 'click.php' didnt redirect to the link. was a missing exit; after header()
		- Onlineversion of newsletter was not shown, the variable was not parsed but preview was ok.
		- Fixed some PHP-Warnings (undefined variables)
		- Http reload in send_it.php didnt work
		- Translations i German had broken Umlauts, was not charset UTF-8 and encoding 8-bit
	
	changes in 1.0.4:	
		- re-ordered menu
		- Default language after installation is now 'en' - english.
		- Smtp user/passwd etc no more required for installation
		- $_SERVER["PHP_AUTH_USER"] gets $LOGIN->USER['name']; AUTH_USER is only used now in the login method, so we can switch to session easily
		- show phpinfo() if mnl_config does not exists. e.g. if index.php is called before installation :) so you can check the php version and settings.

	new features in 1.0.4:
		- Status now show a list of all Groups, and a + icon to show the details which are in a hidden div now, otherwise its sometime too much to view.
		- included knittl's filemanager from myftphp and adapted to run with tellmatic :) its still very experimental. Please visit http://myftphp.sf.net to get the latest Version (Standalone).

	known bugs in 1.0.4:
		- still no PHP auth with cgi version, we need sessions here, but i am prepared, not a bug!
		
		please report any 'bugs'.
