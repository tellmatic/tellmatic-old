		* address sources - in the next releases this is used to save the source key of an entry, e.g. "user" (manual entry), "form","import","subscribe", "sync" or "extern", external id and so on
			  "extern" is for user defineable sources, your own scripts and so on
			  "sync" is ment to log data from the upcoming external-data sync feature (to sync address records between cms, shop, etc with tellmatic)
  			- sync sources will be a new feature in upcoming releases which allows you to conect to external db datasources like your blog, cms, crm tool, shop or whatever 
	  			new column source_id in table adr contains the id of the source: user_id, form_id or sync_id for external tellmatic built in database sources...
				source_extern_id contains the original id in the external database!			
				source_id is user_id on import , or form_id on subscribe!

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+ CHANGES V1.0.8.8  +*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*
	09.07.2010
	
	*** New features/enhancements:
	
		* View newsletter online (massmail & personalized)
			Newsletters can now be shown online.
			Tellmatic does no more make use of the statical parsed html file.
			The file is still created but only ment as a vague preview of your newsletter.
			Tellmatic now uses view.php and the new parseNL method to parse Newsletters on the fly (but still using text or html template files)	
			Newsletters are only shown if newsletter is a massmail or if newsletter is personalized and all values and parameters are valid.
			If all parameters are correct and valid and come from a valid personalized newsletter, a personalized version is created and shown on the fly.
			If the content type of newsletter is text only, a textversion will be shown.
			The Newsletter is only shown if it is active and not a template.
			Personalized Newsletters are only shown if: newsletter is active, not a template and all parameters are valid and address is not unsubscribed and active, also we need a valid history entry, if you delete the history, a personalized newsletter wont be shown!
			{NLONLINE} and {NLONLINE_URL} now points to view.php
			
		* Linkmanager:
		
			Tellmatic comes with a new linkmanager.
			You can create Link Groups and Links belong to one or more Link Groups.
			Links can be personalized. If you have a personalized mailing, {F0}-{F9}, {EMAIL}, {DATE}, {CODE}, and {ADRID} in the URL are replaced with the values from the current address record.
			Link URL can also start with #, then it dont get parsed (can be used as link inside current document, with groups you can easily create an index!)

			* Short: shortname for link, should be unique and not numeric.
			* Name: A name for the link
			* Description: A brief description (shown as title on mouseover or in textmode)
			* URL: a valid URL, start with http://, can be personalized, see above, if URL starts with # it doesn't get parsed

			New Variables for Newsletter:
					* {LNK:[short]}
							e.g.: {LNK:test}
							create a link from link with shortname="test"
							<a href= ....>[name of link]</a>
					* {LNKID:[id]}
							e.g.: {LNKID:1}
							same as above but uses link id
							
					* {LNK_AHREF:[short]}
							e.g.: {LNK_AHREF:test}TEST{CLOSELINK}
							create <a href= ....> from link with shortname="test" without name and closing </a>, you have to use {CLOSELINK}
					* {LNKID_AHREF:[id]}
							e.g.: {LNKID_AHREF:1}
							same as above but uses link id

					* {LNK_URL:[short]}
							e.g.: {LNK_URL:test}
							create URL to click.php?+parameters from link with shortname="test"
					* {LNKID_URL:[id]}
							e.g.: {LNKID_URL:1}
							same as above but uses link id

					* {LNK_URLRAW:[short]}
							e.g.: {LNK_URLRAW:test}
							create URL to raw URL as given in link with shortname="test"
					* {LNKID_URLRAW:[id]}
							e.g.: {LNKID_URLRAW:1}
							same as above but uses link id

					* {LNKGRP:[kurz]}
							e.g.: {LNKGRP:infos}
							creates a small header with group name and description and a list of links which belong to group with shortname="infos"
					* {LNKGRPID:[id]}
							e.g.: {LNKGRPID:1}
							same as above but uses link group id
			Notes:				
				Links and link groups are only shown if active.
				The Linktracker does some nice click tracking but may make heavy use of the lnk_click table which can get very huge in some cases.
				There is no statistics yet. Clicks get saved in the lnk_click table and data for statistics are available at this time but not shown on the statistics page or status etc. (if you need statistics you have to do your own SQL)
				Statistics and Reports come in the next release.
				Statistics can't be deleted yet, there will be functions to clean up clickstats in the next releases. 
				IP is logged, unique key for table lnk_click is lnk_id,nl_id,q_id,a_id,h_id,ip, insert on duplicate keys will only increase the counter (clicks)				
				LINK1 and LINK1_URL are still available and won't get removed.
			
		* Logging:
			Added global logging mechanism. logs all changes to database.
			To deactivate the logbook set TM_LOG to FALSE in tm_lib.inc.php (TRUE, >=	 1.0.8.8)
			All actions in the admin interface are now logged (adr,nl,blacklist,config,forms,hosts,users,q/h), except selects and views. (Logging is enabled for creation, edit and delete only), some actions only add a memo (e.g. when cleaning up database only the action and filter is saved)!
			If you are an admin user you will see 2 new links. the top link is for current section. the link on bottom shows all entrys in logbook.
			Each Entry now also have a Link to show logbook entries.
			Try it out, works great.
			A nice feature also is that all edited data gets logged too and if you delete an item its values are also logged..... ;-) 
			Logbook can be searched, filtered and flushed, or only delete a selection....
			It may be possibility to replay changes and save old/new data, but this is not implemented yet.
					
		* Check for duplicates
			Tellmatic now has some methods to check and remove duplicates from the database.
			Clean Up Form now has option to remove duplicates (from all groups). You can choose what entry you like keep in database (first/oldest, last/latest, random).
			Duplicates can be exported before deletion.

		* Import domains to blacklist:
			domains can now be imported to the blacklist via the address import form.

		* enable/disable personalized tracking (now an opton in newsletter)
			if personalized tracking is disabled Tellmatic does only anonymous logging (newsletter id, queue id, but no adr id and history id)
		* export bounced / deleted addresses
			bounce_it.php now exports deleted address records as CSV.
	
	*** Enhacements, Code changes / Optimizations:
	
		* adr: added genCSV() method to create CSV lines
		* send_it.php now uses new parser method parseNL() for newsletter parsing.
		* send_it.php logfile created on the fly, format changed, use unique timestamp, easy to tail -f. extension is still .html but contains only plaintext
		* send_it.php: now detects if run via browser or cli
		* slightly adjusted php error logfile format
		* Classes now always return siteid in array for get methods!
		* Parser for Newsletter parseNL()
		* use sendmail_smtp function (host_test, subscribe, unsubscribe, send_it status mails)
		* addClick, addView, addSub, addNL methods in tm_NL/ADR/FRM now use simple sql to increase counters! no more fetching record record first and increase via php and do an update :P
		* queue_new: show only groups with valid addresses
		* queue_new: sort newsletter, latest on top 
		* queue_new, queue add link in nl_list: only show nl/link if all tempates exists
			https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=933192&aid=2971854&group_id=190396
		
	*** fixed Bugs:
	
		* sendmail_smtp/functions.inc: missing parameter: 
			$email_obj->maximum_piped_recipients=$HOST_T[0]['smtp_max_piped_rcpt'];
			SendMail_smtp: now return array [0]: true/fale [1]: errormessage if false or empty
			This could lead in an error on subscribe/unsubscribe if smtp server uses tarpiting or greetdelay or teergrubing etc in some rare cases.
		* class_adr: getGroup:if ($adr_id >0) { should be check_dbid()
		* php_error: closedir(): supplied argument is not a valid Directory resource, /include/Functions.inc.php line 238
		* nl_form: php_error: basename() expects parameter 1 to be string, array given include/nl_form.inc.php line 123, fixed: if not empty....
		* nl_form: array sizes inconsistent: btsort was not resettet as empty array
		* php_error: mysql_free_result(): supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result resource include/Class_DB.inc.php line 148 after operation
			only call free() method if we read big datasets or if we have limited memory.
			deactivated free() and call manually after select
		* send_it: blacklisted is not an error. if blacklisted status 4 was set but should not change status at all. so we can use blacklist temporaryliy
			https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=933195&aid=2971858&group_id=190396	
		* queue_new: after adding new queue: PHP Error 2/Warning "mysql_num_rows(): supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result resource" in File: Class_DB.inc.php  at Line: 278
		* check_it: missing $ and ; 
			https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=933192&aid=2962261&group_id=190396
		* Functions.inc.php: checkemailadr: missing $from parameter for validate
		* export: english translation says import!
		* https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=933192&aid=2958182&group_id=190396, first, lastURLpara unknown notice.... link pager doesnt work !
		* bl_list: unknown object, unknown entrys_total
		* newsletter subject variables were not replaced if nl was massmailing
		* etc.

		and maybe some more optimizations and bugfixes not listed here.....	
		see ChangeLog for more Details		

	*** Known Issues:
	
		* Tellmatic <= 1.0.8.8 does not work with PHP >=5.3
			The PHP guys removed the zend.ze1_compatibility_mode directive (object values vs. references) which is still needed in Tellmatic <= 1.0.8.8
			Tellmatic was developed using PHP4 and still uses some backward compatibility settings.
			At this time, PHP 5.3 is quite new and mostly used on testing distributions, stable linux servers may still use PHP 5.2
		* Yes! there is still no online documentation. This is a heavy job, coding is much easier and more exciting yet.
		* Still using very outdated filemanager... Use at your own risk! You better use FTP!!!
		
	*** Upcoming:
	
		* Filemanager?
		* Documentation online?
		* All or most of improvements i mentioned above (Statistics etc).
		* Get rid of zend compat mode, prepare for PHP 5.3 (need tester and free hosting with php5.3!!!!)
		* Welcome newsletter (personalized newsletter send out on subscribe, unsubscribe...)
		* User definable variables
		* Languages (define languages, set nl lang, user may choose on subscribe)
		* Content type (user may choose on subscribe text/html)
		...and more

	23.2.2010
	
	*** New features/enhancements:
		
		- Since 1.0.8.7 Tellmatic has 2 new scripts you can start manually via the menu or with cronjob
			pleae read the INSTALL.xx file!
			- automagic bouncemanagement:
				include/bounce_it.php
				This script opens a mailbox on the selected server and checks for bouncemails, fetch emailaddresss and do something with it (action) 
				Automagic bouncemanagement behaviour can be configured in the admin - settings menu (see below)
				The script adds a memo  with debug info if an address fails and exports bounced addresses to a file in the files/import_export directory
			- quality check/address validation:
				include/check_it.php
				This Script validates flagged/marked email addresses and optionally set new status, etc. 
				Behaviour can be configured in the admin - settings menu (see below)
				The script adds a memo  with debug info if an address fails			
				Class_ADR.inc.php: tm_ADR->markRecheck()
		- check e-mail-addresses:
			check/validate email addresses via link from list (the new spellcheck icon)	or via form below adr list (also choose from syntax , mx/dns or validation)
			a click on the spellcheck icon gives some more debugging results
		- unsubscribe: send e-mail to un-subscriber (optional - see settings). Template is: tpl/Unsubscribe_mail.html
		- newsletter: memo is now a variable for the newsletter: {MEMO}
		- Admin - Settings:	New Options for unsubscribe, auto-bounce, validation script and send routine:
			- send_it: 
				- choose e-mail check method
			- unsuscribe:
				- unsubscribe: use captcha: default 0/disabled
				- unsubscribe: how many captcha digits: default 4
				- unsubscribe: send memo to un-subscriber: tpl/Unsubscribe_mail.html
				- unsubscribe: choose action: unsubscribe (set status and deactivate entry) or finally delete from database (no undo)?
			- check_it:
				- choose e-mail check method
				- validate email-from-addres: address to check via validation script. use sender address of default  host if empty 
				- mark as ok if address was errorness (status 9, a-error)?
				- reset error counter if address check was successful?
				- set limit on how many addresses should be checked on each run: default 25		
			- bounce_it:
				- bounce method (body, header etc), action: move, delete, auto, unsubscribe etc
				- select pop3/imap host
				- set limit on how many emails should be checked at once: default 10
				- select search method: header and body, only body, only header
				- choose action: auto , mark as errorness/failed, unsubscribe and deactivate, deactivate, delete
				- filter emails, only search mails to from: address: default 0
				- from_address for filter: default ''
		- import: mark for recheck/validation
		- send_it, check_it and bounce_it have now links in menu and will not be called directly! Instead a page with some hints will be shown and a link to load the script directly in the browser.
		- create new Item: add some default values/errormessages in current language in all forms when creating a new entry (adr, form, nl, etc)
		- rechecked tab index in all forms 
		- adress list: shows summary of total addresses and per selected and marked/deactivated entries
		- search adresses: filter for active addresses
		- clean up database now has an option to mark addresses for validation/recheck using check_it.php
		- clean up database disables unneeded inputs depending on what action you select (as in import, hosts etc)
		- clean up database now shows amount of marked addresses for recheck, total and for each group, and deactivated addresses
	
	*** Code changes / Optimizations:
		- install: safemode warning is now info!
		- Functions: validate_email: fsockopen now has timeout and errno
		- Functions: validate_email: error 4xx should be no address-error but send error (greylisted, deferred, temp error)
		- unsubscribe: should only check for syntax, not mx/dns or validate, now only checks for syntax!
		- error_reporting: disabled notices because auto bouncemanagement may have 0 mails and this gives a notice in the php logfile.if you run the script often and there is an empty mailbox this would lead to a logfile with a few hundreds MB... :>
		- Functions: validate_email: from-address is now sender address of default/selected host.
		- Funktions: validate_email: accepts $from addres, or use default from default/selected host if empty
		- send_it: add memo if address check fails
		- default for USE_TMP_HTML_FILES is TRUE, make sure admin/tmp is writeable by the webserver. To disable feature, set USE_TMP_HTML_FILES to FALSE in tm_lib.inc.php

	*** new API examples:
		- api_example_dev_001.php:
			list addresses which are in more than one group
		- api_example_dev_002.php:
			show a list of newsletters					
		- api_example_dev_003.php:
			shows a list of already send newsletters (get nl list from q instead of nl)
		- api_example_dev_004.php:
			output list of archived newsletters to a rss-xml file
		
		Note: remove exit command at top of file!

	*** fixed Bugs:
		- subscribe.inc.php: c= was not code= in 1086, fixed now. Now using $code instead of $c
		- install: files/tmp was checked twice
		- https://sourceforge.net/projects/tellmatic/forums/forum/670072/topic/3539879/index/page/1
			subscribe.inc.php date_sub for mail and template should be formatted by TM_NL_DATEFORMAT
			$date_sub=date(TM_NL_DATEFORMAT);
		- DEBUG_SQL had no effect using temp html files. now debug output/queries is included in $_MAIN_MESSAGE 
		- export: in 1086, if status was choosen as a filter, there was no export. this was because of a change in the api, weird bug, weird php....
		- validate email now uses default host or given host
		- unsubscribe:  typeNotice Undefined variable: author , file:include/unsubscribe.inc.php
			author is now "unsubscribe"
		- send_it: 732: undefined var a_error, h_error: fixed
		- send_it: 634:  undefined index summary
	 	- UPDATE: ALTER TABLE `nl` ADD `is_template` TINYINT(1) default 0 after `track_image`, was "tracking_image"
		- Functions.inc.php: typeNotice Undefined index:  HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR include/Functions.inc.php line 303
		- send_it: h entry should not be marked as errorness if entry has already been processed....!
			Not a critical bug :) just the results in the statistics are a bit messed up. The error counter for the newsletter queue had some false results! now fixed.	now the entry is skipped and status is not changed!
			
			
*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+ CHANGES V1.0.8.6  +*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*
	06.01.2010

	Sorry, still no new filemanager, hopefully coming soon. 
	Sorry, still no working online documentation.
	Your donations are welcome. i can not do this without your help.		
		
	Some of the new festures n 1.0.8.6, like title, sub-title and summary in newsletters were sponsored by Schroewig News and Images Berlin (www.schroewig.com)		
	As usual, i tried to implement new features in a way so that new functions will be useful for everyone not just for the sponsor.
		(This is why sponsors would never pay the whole work, just a few bucks.
		so... if you need some special features, please ask, its not that expensive as you think)
		
	Additionally i decided to add the 'uploaded image resize and watermark' function permanently to Tellmatic.  
	I also added some new api examples to demonstrate the new festures for displaying newsletters summaries on a website		
	
	Wichtiger Hinweis fuer Newsletterversender aus dem deutschen Raum:
	"Das LG Heidelberg hat in einer aktuellen Entscheidung (LG Heidelberg, Urt. v. 23.09.2009 - Az.: 1 S 15/09)
	noch einmal bestätigt, dass das Confirmed-Opt-In-Verfahren bei E-Mail-Werbung unzureichend ist, um einen Missbrauch zu vermeiden."
	Quelle: http://www.online-und-recht.de/urteile/Confirmed-Opt-In-Verfahren-nicht-geeignet-um-Missbrauch-zu-verhindern-1-S-15-09-Landgericht-Heidelberg-20090923.html
	
	*** New features/enhancements:
		* Newsletter: added Title, SubTitle and Summary
			These new fields are mainly used to show a quick summary of the newsletters on your website.
			title, title_sub and summary
			for an example please see api_example_dev_02.php
			there are 3 new variables for this fields you can use in your newsletter body too:
			{TITLE} to show the title text
			{TITLE_SUB} to show the subtitle text
			and
			{SUMMARY} to show a quick summary
			the fields title and subtitle are below the subject field and summary is hidden below the html body textarea.
			to enter a summary you can use wysiwyg too.
			summary and titles are not parsed! no {} variables available yet.
			be careful using a html formatted summary in text body, if you want to use {SUMMARY} in a text body, you should write plain text only in the summary.
			if you have a plaintext summary for text body and want use it in html body too, just put a 'pre' tag around it. 

			added 3 new database fields in newsletter table: 
				title varchar(255)
				title_sub varchar(255)
				and
				summary longtext
			
			This feature was sponsored by SCHROEWIG News & Images (http://www.schroewig.com)
			If everything goes well, this is the first step in implementing a complete news-system and some frontend (...write some news and make a newsletter form it.)

		* Newsletter templates: save newsletter as a template to create new newsletters from it (e.g different predefined layouts).
			activate 'template' checkbox at top of newsletter form to make a newsletter a template.
			templates can't be send or queued.
			to see your newsletter templates and create a new newsletter from one of your templates, 
			just click on 'templates' in the menu (newsletter section) and copy the template by clicking on link on the right side
			to show actions and choose copy, or copy+files.
			if a template is copied, it is no template by default and the normal list will shown up listing only newsletters which are no template.
			if you create a newsletter and make it a template, after saving the list of templates will be shown and vice versa.
			for this, i added a new menu entry and 2 new parameters $search to countNL() and getNL() method in the class and a new method 
			set_as_template() whichis not used yet. 
			new database field was added in newsletter table:
				is_template tinyint(1)
			
			see also code changes.
			
			This is almost the same as copying already created newsletters, but flagging it explicitely as a template makes handling much easier. 

		* Newsletter: uploaded image can be resized and watermarked.
				* only jpegs can be resized and/or watermarked (no check for imagetype, jpeg only for now)
				* resize is first
				* watermarks can only be png files. default is watermark.png in /img directory
				* resulting image is always jpeg
				i could add a lot of more features just for the uploaded image, but that would be a bit overloaded!
				image functions and uploading images with some more features will go to the "coming soon" universal Tellmatic filemanager.

					
		* search Addresses is now a Menu Entry giving a blank search mask without showing an initial list (parameter: no_list=1)
		* optionally save address search parameters in session cookie (fixed some issues here for saved session paras)
		* added link in address search mask to reset saved cookie search parameters
		* pager now shows links to pages, start and end of list		
		* inactive address group names are now shown in red (address list)
		* if address list is empty after searching for an email, add link to create a new address entry with given email		

		...Sorry, filemanager still not finished :( lots of work!
				 
	*** Code changes / Optimizations:
		* Newsletter: 
			added search parameter (array) in getNL() and countNL()
			'status', 'aktiv', 'is_template'
			for now its only used to filter templates and for status in your frontend maybe ;-) see api examples
				function getNL($id=0,$offset=0,$limit=0,$group_id=0,$return_content=0,$sortIndex="",$sortType=0,$search=Array())
				function countNL($group_id=0,$search=Array())
			added new method set_as_template() - not used yet, just for completition and later use.
		
		* Newsletter recipient name: parse and replace {EMAIL} with recipients email.
			BE CAREFUL! i got trouble using emailaddresses in recipients name. may lead into malformed email! just for testing.
		 
		* moved loader bar, changed css in all templates, sorry, debug window may still popup...
		* subscribe.inc.php, send_it.php, unsubscribe.inc.php, unsubscribe_form.inc.php: changec $c to $code
		* Functions.inc.php new functions: watermark(), createThumb()
		* Class_NL, Class_ADR: filter search for status accepts array for OR search

	*** Bugs fixed
		wysiwyg: fixed wysiwyg advanced theme. didnt work with gzipped js..., fallback to standard js script
		wysiwyg: fixed some stuff with default language in editor		
		Undefined index: HTTPS in include/tm_config.inc.php on line 3, fixed. 
		getDomainName: returns error if [1] not set, check with isset. only occurs if syntaxcheck is disabled: Functions.inc.php
		newsletter groups: do not 'translate' html entities for description. old bug. fixed.
		unsubscribe: email still in textfield after succesfull unsubscribe. now field is empty.

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+ CHANGES V1.0.8.4  +*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*
	29.01.2009
	a lot has changed in this version. almost all known bugs were fixed. the gui gets enhanced and i added a lot of new features.
	also i recoded a new send-routine. this doesn't use weird php code anymore and i no more such a memory and time consumption. the stuff is done now directly in sql.
	this new send-routine allows us now to add new addresses to a Q just before sending, regardless when you have created the Q and recipients list!
	(In detail: it uses a temporary table to preselect already existing addresses in the recipientslist and exclude those from being added twice to the list and only new entries will be added.)
	
	*** New features:
	
		- Sending/Queues: now using the "fast method"! When creating a new Q, you now can select if the Q should start and recreate the recipients list automagical.
			If you select this option, the Q starts automagical and recreates and updates the recipients list regardless if you create it now. This means you can now leave the checkbox for creating a recipients list just after adding the Q empty if you dont want to do that now and let Tellmatic create the list (TM will send an email if a rcpt-list gets updated).
			Add new addresses to existing queues was solved using some magic SQL. 
			In the Q list you can click to update the recipients list with new addresses. 
			This is usefull if you plan a Q and visitors still subscribe to the newsletter.
			this can also be done automagically by Tellmatic just before sending! new Q actions: create list now, create list automatical, do not create list/manually
			Also if a new user subscribes to a form and gets added to a group which has active queues the address gets added to the list if the Q has not already started.
			- links in list view to recreate recipients list in addressgroup list and newsletter list (only if new or started Q's exists for the selected addressgroup or newsletter) and queue list.
				(if you recreate rcpt-list for a newsletter or address-group, all Q entries for this items are affected! To recreate the list of single Q entries use te Q list!) 
			- send mails: recreate recipients list automagical (optional)
			(Class Q: function getQtoPrepare($search=Array()),	function setAutogen($id=0,$autogen=1))	
			There was also a discussion about this in the forum at http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=2392205&forum_id=670073
			Details: 	if you have 2 queues (or more) for one newsletter and some address-groups  (bear in mind that each Q entry is for a newsletter for one address-group!) 
							which have not been started yet, and you start one of this Q's, only the addresses for this Q for the selected group which do NOT exist in another group 
							for the same newsletter gets added to the recipients-list!
							Example:	adr1 is in grp1, adr2 is member of grp1 and grp2 and adr3 is member of grp3. you create a new Q for nl1 addressed to grp1, grp2 and grp3. Q's are not started and have date in future. Recipients list was not created yet. 
											Now, if you watch the Q list for nl1 and create the rcpt-list for grp1, only adr2 gets added to the list! (you may have expected that adr1 and adr2 gets added ;-)
											(If you have an address which is member of 3 groups and you have 3 unstarted Q's, the address will only be added in the last started Q for its groups.)
							This makes it easy to add addresses from different groups step by step and keep them up to date. only unique addresses from a group will be added! 
							It's a kind of a side-effect resulting from the new code. I added it as a feature! this is not a bug!  
			
			ATTENTION! This feature is completely new and rewritten. there was no need to keep the old method. the old method used too much memory and time to create the list with pure php.....
			Ich tested it many times for different caes and it looks very fine. But i CAN NOT promise that it works for 100% yet, maybe 99,9% :>   
				
		- nl: use {DATE} in a newsletter subject, text and uploaded html files to display current date (Y-m-d). The format of the datestamp is defined as TM_NL_DATEFORMAT in tm_lib.inc.php
		- nl: use {CODE} in newsletter text. The "code" yet is only used for double-in subscription to make the URL more individual. The "code" may be used for later functions. 
		- nl: attachements uses subdirs and are shown as a group for ech dir. Only 1 dirlevel is supported!
		- Config/Settings: 	select default SMTP host. This is the default SMTP host for sending internal mails and subscription mails. This is the pre-selected host for new queues. See changes for 'hosts' below
										now all SMTP settings are saved in the host entry and come from the selected SMTP host. 
		- hosts: set "from", "return-path" "from name" etc. used for sending emails via the selected SMTP host.
		- hosts: enable SSL
		- hosts: set "max_piped_recipients" for SMTP. Be carefull changing this setting. This tells your server to send N recipient addresses as one pipe before waiting for OK! Do not change this if your server uses tarpitting etc.
		- hosts: "max_bcc" and "max rcpt per mail" is now set in hosts. Sending now use values from selected SMTP host.
		  memo: internal status mails send from tellmatic to the admin or user and all mails send via form-subscription uses the default SMTP host.
		
		- bouncemanagement: better addressdetection in definable headers, detect potential looking like an emailaddresss, check headers not only for x-failed but all headers, also with headers continuing on the next line! works good and is ok so far, detects more addresses!

		- testaddresses: just a new include file, this adds some testaddresses to your database. Please ne careful! This script is disabled by default and should only used for testing a new database, not in production!!! use it on your own risk! you can really mess up your database :) i tried it out for you. (just a warning, experienced users should have look at it anyway)
		- lost password: example file "reset_pw.php" to reset your lost Tellmatic password
	
	*** GUI changes
		- added new translations and language packs for "nl" (dutch/flemish) and "pt" (portuguese/brazil)
			Credits goes to
			* Dutch: Rob J Wierenga, Yard-IT BV
			* Portuguese: Elizandro Baldin (Brazil)
	
		- improved GUI and Menu using mootools fx slider to slide in and out the menu entries and messages etc.
		- revied all forms and corrected/adjusted tabindex.
		- ALL icons have a quick mouseover helptext showing as a speechbubble		
		- list views: added pager to almost all lists. (if more than N entries are shown in a list the pager will be displayed)
		- status: status etc is displayed now in tables and use rowcolor effect for mouseover.
		- newsletter: when editing or creating a newsletter the size of the attachements will be shown in the list.
		- newsletter: show attachements size and summary in the details of the newsletter list view. Give a waring if a file does not exist. (edit newsletter once and save to fix this, lost files gets de-refereenced from the attm list)
		- beautified the "new Q" form.
		- address list: show a warning if sending errors have reached the limit.
